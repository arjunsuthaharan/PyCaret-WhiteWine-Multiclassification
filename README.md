# PyCaret-WhiteWine-Multiclassification

# Abstract

White wine is one of the oldest drinks in human history, and has many different factors and considerations put into it when its being made. There are many measures considered in order to make a white wine unique from the others. Using a dataset of thousands of different white wines provided by the UCI Machine Learning Repository, we wanted to determine if it was possible to predict the quality level of a white wine, given several numerical measures, including  fixed and volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free and total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulfate and alcohol, to predict quality, on a score of 0-10 using multiclassification. Utilizing PyCaret, after generating and testing 15 unique machine learning models, it was found that random forest was the highest performing model in respect to F1 Score. This model was then tuned using PyCaret's built in tuning methods and tested. The final model was a random forest classifier model with a 65.8% accuracy, 37.1% recall score, 65.2% precision score and  65.1% F1 Score.
